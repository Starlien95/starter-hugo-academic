abstract: "Graphs can model complex relationships between objects, enabling a
  myriad of Web applications such as online page/article classification and
  social recommendation. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a
  powerful tool for graph representation

  learning, in an end-to-end supervised setting, their performance heavily
  rely on a large amount of task-specific supervision. To re\x02duce labeling
  requirement, the “pre-train, finetune” and “pre-train, prompt” paradigms have
  become increasingly common. In particular, prompting is a popular alternative
  to fine-tuning in natural language processing, which is designed to narrow the
  gap between pre-training and downstream objectives in a task-specific manner.
  However, existing study of prompting on graphs is still limited, lacking a
  universal treatment to appeal to different downstream tasks. In this paper, we
  propose GraphPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework on graphs.
  GraphPrompt not only unifies pre-training and downstream tasks into a common
  task template, but also employs a learnable prompt to assist a downstream task
  in locating the most relevant knowledge from the pre-train model in a
  task-specific manner. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five public
  datasets to evaluate and analyze GraphPrompt."
